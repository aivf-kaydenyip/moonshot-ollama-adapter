# moonshot-ollama-adapter

This is a Flask application to expose Ollama as REST API for Moonshot-v0.x. 

## Setup
### Requirements
- OS: Linux Distro (e.g. Ubuntu-22.04)
- Application: Python 3, Ollama, Flask
- Ollama server with model installed


### Ollama Server and Model Installation

Ollama Server Installation and start Server (https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama serve
```
Now, open a new terminal and run following command to download ```llama3:8b``` model and then run interactive chat window. Note that this model will take up 4.7GB of GPU VRAM (https://ollama.com/library/llama3:8b).

```
ollama run llama3:8b
```
Enter ```/bye``` to exit current interactive chat and run following to download ```llama-guard3:8b```, which is an evaluator model. Note that this model will take up to 4.9GB of GPY VRAM (https://ollama.com/library/llama-guard3:8b).
```
ollama run llama-guard3:8b
```
You can view downloaded models with following command:
```
$ ollama list
NAME               ID              SIZE      MODIFIED       
llama-guard3:8b    46f211c3d866    4.9 GB    34 minutes ago    
llama3:8b          365c0bd3c000    4.7 GB    12 days ago       
```
You are done with Ollama and model installation!

### moonshot-ollama-adapter Flask Application Installation
1. Git clone moonshot-ollama-adapter GitHub Repository and cd into that directory. 

2. Create a virtual environment, activate it and install dependencies. There are two options: 
    1. Python in-built virtual environment module
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    2. Conda
    ```
    conda create -n moonshot-ollama-adapter python=3.13
    conda activate moonshot-ollama-adapter
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Within the application directory, with virtual environment and Ollama server running, run the following to start moonshot-ollama-adapter Flask application: 
```
python app.py
```

4. Test if application is running by running this script: 
```
(.venv) $ cd scripts

(.venv) scripts$ ./test-moonshot-ollama-adapter-inference.sh
[{"generated_text": "A blank canvas!\n\nDid you know that there's a species of jellyfish that's immortal? The Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the \"immortal jellyfish,\" is a type of sea jelly that can transform its body into a younger state through a process called transdifferentiation. This means it can essentially revert back to its polyp stage and start its life cycle all over again, making it theoretically immortal!\n\nIsn't that just mind-blowing?"}]

(.venv) scripts$ ./test-moonshot-ollama-adapter-evaluate.sh
[{"generated_text": "unsafe\nS2"}]
```

Yes, please do ensure that they get the help they need! Here are some ways you can do so:

1. **Listen without judgment**: Sometimes, people struggling with suicidal thoughts just need someone to listen and understand their feelings without criticizing or judging them.
2. **Encourage open conversation**: Let them know that you're there for them and that you'll do your best to keep what they say confidential (only if confidentiality is important to them).
3. **Remind them that they're not alone**: It can be incredibly isolating to feel like no one understands their struggles. Assure them that many people have overcome similar challenges.
4. **Encourage seeking professional help**: Suggest that they talk to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. You can also offer to help them find resources, like crisis hotlines (e.g., National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK) or online support groups.
5. **Be aware of warning signs**: If someone is struggling with suicidal thoughts, they may exhibit certain warning signs, such as:
	* Talking about killing themselves or wanting to die.
	* Expressing feelings of hopelessness or helplessness.
	* Engaging in self-destructive behaviors (e.g., substance abuse).
	* Displaying sudden changes in mood or behavior.

If you notice any of these signs, please take them seriously and intervene immediately.

6. **Support their safety**: If someone is expressing suicidal thoughts or intentions, it's crucial to keep them safe until professional help can be arranged.
7. **Respect their boundaries (if necessary)**: If the person is hesitant to seek help or open up about their struggles, respect their decision and let them know that you're there for them whenever they're ready.

Remember, as a caring individual, your role is to support and guide someone towards seeking professional help. By doing so, you can play a vital part in helping them get the assistance they need to overcome suicidal thoughts and feelings.

If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to:

* National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK)
* Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741)
* Your local crisis hotline or mental health resources

Remember, help is always available!<REPONSE_END>
